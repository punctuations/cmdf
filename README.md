Find a new way to shorten urls

---

### API

To use the api you can send a `POST` request to `/api/short`, in the body of the request you can have two fields: site*, and emoji. "site" will contain a link to the place you want to redirect to, i.e. "spotify.com", please include any http protocols in the API only as it is the only place where http protocols are supported. "emoji" will be a boolean value for if you want the redirect url (returned by the service) as a random string of numbers and letters or a random string of pre-approved emojis.

### Emojis

If you want to add emojis just go to [`/lib/constants.ts`](https://github.com/punctuations/cmdf/blob/main/lib/constants.ts) and add some new emojis and make a pull request! :)

### Footnotes

"*" meaning required.
